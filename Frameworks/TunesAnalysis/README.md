#  TunesAnalysis

"Lightweight" low-level library consisting mostly of glue code to other projects. It allows a Swift application to apply this analysis with minimal setup.

## Setup

* Place or symlink taglib to ./taglib 
* Place or symlink essentia to ./essentia
* Place or symlink libsamplerate to ./libsamplerate
* Install dependencies: brew install eigen libsamplerate taglib
* The rest is configured to build from the project!
