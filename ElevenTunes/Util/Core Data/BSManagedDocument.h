//  A document class that mimics UIManagedDocument to support Core Data in all its modern glory:
//
//  *   Saves to a file package
//
//  *   On 10.7+, asynchronous saving is supported. We insert a parent context between the persistent store coordinator and the     "main" managed object context (the one with main queue concurrency type that is returned by -managedObjectContext).  The parent context is of private queue concurrency type and therefore saves on its own thread.  (Note that, even as late as macOS 10.15 in September 2019, NSPersistendDocument still does *not* support asynchronous saving.  (See Apple documentation > AppKit > NSPersistentDocument > Overview > Important.
//
//  *   Full support for concurrent document opening too
//
//  *   Subclasses can hook in to manage additional content inside the package
//
//  *   A hook is also provided at the best time to set metadata for the store
//
//  *   New docs have the bundle bit set on them. It means that if the doc gets transferred to a Mac without your app installed, with the bundle bit still intact, it will still appear in the Finder as a file package rather than a folder
//
//  *   If the document moves on disk, Core Data is kept informed of the new location
//
//  *   If multiple validation errors occur during saving, the presented error is adjusted to make debugging a little easier
//
//  *   And of course, full support for Autosave-In-Place and Versions
//
//  NOTE: Prior to OS X 10.9, there was a major flaw in Core Data's handling of Externally Stored
//  Data Attributes. The subsystem that handles with them was unable to deal with the persistent
//  store being moved/renamed. It would attempt to work with external data at the OLD store location,
//  instead of the new, and throw an exception when that failed. The described scenario happens
//  whenever a user moves or renames the document (this is supposed to be supported behaviour on OS X).
//  But just as importantly, when a new document gets explicitly saved by the user for the first
//  time, it transitions from being stored in a temporary folder, to the real location, also
//  triggering the bug. Only happens when there is data added to the document large enough for Core
//  Data to try and store it externally, so make sure you take that into account if trying to repro!
//  Reported as rdar://problem/13023874

 You override this method to perform to manage non-Core Data content to be
 stored in the additional content directory in the document’s file package.
 
 If you implement this method, it is invoked automatically by `BSManagedDocument`
 while saving. The returned object is passed to
 `-writeAdditionalContent:toURL:originalContentsURL:error:`.
 
 Called before any contexts are saved, so this may be a good point to do some
 last-minute adjustments to your Core Data objects.
 
 There is no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.
 
 ### Special Considerations
 
 A return value of `nil` indicates an error condition. To avoid generating an
 exception, you must return a value from this method. If it is not always the
 case that there will be additional content, you should return a sentinel value
 (for example, an `NSNull` instance) that you check for in
 `-writeAdditionalContent:toURL:originalContentsURL:error:`.
 
 The object returned from this method is passed to
 `-writeAdditionalContent:toURL:originalContentsURL:error:`. Because
 `-writeAdditionalContent:toURL:originalContentsURL:error:` is likely executed
 on a different thread, you must ensure that the object you return is
 thread-safe. For example, you might return an `NSData` object containing an
 archive of the state you want to capture.

 @param absoluteOriginalContentsURL The current URL of the document that is being saved.
 @param error Upon return, if a problem occurs, contains an error object that describes the problem.
 @return `YES` if the write operation is successful, otherwise `NO`.
 
 You override this method to perform to write non-Core Data content in the additional content directory in the document’s file package. There are several issues to consider:
 
 * You should typically implement this method only if you have also implemented
 `-additionalContentForURL:error:`.
 * Because this method is executed asynchronously, it is possible that the
 document’s state may be different from that at which the save operation was
 initiated. If you need to capture the document state at save time, you should
 do so in `-additionalContentForURL:error:`.
 * If you implement this method, it is invoked automatically by
 `-writeContents:andAttributes:safelyToURL:forSaveOperation:error:`.
 * There is no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.
 
 ### Special Considerations
 
 This method is called after context(s) have been saved to disk, so the document
 is already partially written. You should avoid returning `NO` if possible, as
 that reports an error to the user, but leaves the document in a partially
 updated state.

 Called just before the context is saved, giving you a chance to adjust the
 store's metadata. The default implementation leaves the existing metadata
 untouched and returns `YES`. You should only override to return `NO` if storing
 the metadata went wrong in a critical way that stops the doc from being saved.

 makes a copy of the document. You might override to speed it up by hard linking
